## Designing a modern, sleek micro serif font.

Hybrid serif fonts are characterized by their small, almost negligible serifs. They combine the readability of sans serif fonts (like helvetica) and the sophistication of traditional serif fonts. 

This style of font is perfect for our client (the library) as it is still legible, yet it embodies the history of WPI and its library though the addition of a serif

## The Design Process and philosophy.

We began by looking at more modern serif fonts such as EB Garamond, Times New Roman, and Baskerville; and comparing them to more modern sans serif fonts such as Roboto, Trebuchet MS, and the infamous Helvetica.

Between the six fonts we can see notable difference and similarities:

The sans serif fonts are generally bolder, making them more legible than the serif fonts. However, the style of the serif fonts is more visually appealing. Notably, serif fonts are generally more stylish, and evoke a long history of typefaces. implicitly implying a sense of authority. We decided on a hybrid typeface to account for these observations and to best align with the modern needs and use cases of the WPI library.

## Final Thoughts

This hybrid typeface will allow us to have the legibility of the sans serif fonts, along with the style of the serif fonts, making our font easy to read while also evoking emotion. 

We hope that by using a hybrid serif font we can draw more people into libraries, most forget that libraries are not simple repositories of books, librarians are researchers, libraries often serve as vital knowledge archives; preserving local history, providing communities with internet access, and the general public with safe and warm places to grow.

We believe that a hybrid serif font reflects this great purpose of the modern library.
