**Six-Cell Action: Designing a Library Comic for WPI Students**

The name we chose for our comic strip is *Six-Cell Action*. This is because each page in the comic will have six cells of art for us to convey our message. The actual name of the comic itself will be *Knowledgeable Gordon* because it is about the George C. Gordon Library and the vast knowledge it contains. Another reason why this is a good name for the comic is that students can easily enhance their own knowledge just by studying there, even if they are not reading a book.

The main audience of this comic will be any student at WPI. Our goal for this comic is to draw them into the library. We want to teach them about the potential they have and how that potential can grow just by entering the library. We need to show them how much easier it is to study and get academic help there than in any other building on campus. If we do that, then our comic will be successful.

We chose to use this six-cell format so that we can pack as much information as possible onto one page. Teenagers tend to have a rather short attention span, so we figured that if they do not have to flip through many pages, we can keep them hooked. That is vital because we need them engaged so our message can be heard. If they are not intrigued, they will not want to come study at the library.

The comic *Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art*, written by Scott McCloud, displays various types of comic styles that we could use to help make our comic more interesting for teenagers. Word-specific panels are when the words provide the information and the pictures do not add much. Picture-specific panels are the opposite. There is also duo-specific, which is when the image and the words portray the exact same message. We should avoid this. Then, there are different types of combinations: additive, parallel, montage, and interdependent. Additive is when either the words or the picture elaborate on the message of the other. Parallel is when words and images in the same panel seem to be talking about two completely different messages. A montage combination is when the words are a part of the picture. Lastly, an interdependent combination is when words and pictures work together to portray a message that neither the words nor the pictures could convey alone (McCloud 153).

These types of comic panels were part of what helped form our design. We had to choose the correct types of panels for the right scenes so that we could maximize the intrigue in our reader, who is a WPI student. Choosing the right panels for the comic is important because it could make or break the story. Our text and images support each other because we decided to always have one emphasize or elaborate on the other. We never had our words and images say the exact same thing without adding additional detail. We were able to overcome the tendency of over-relying on images or words by shifting the balance of power between the two in each panel. If words described the main message in one panel, then images would in the next, and vice versa.

In each frame, we chose to emphasize the character’s emotion—how they feel about the situation at hand. We felt that this was the best way to connect with the audience, and that is crucial because if we do not connect with the audience, then why would they continue reading our comic? Providing them with a main character who has relatable emotions and feelings will keep them clinging to the comic, and as a result, they will learn from the comic’s message, which is that they should go to the library.

The main challenge for us was creating the images and making them actually look good. You have to remember, this is an art, and we are not artists. During the design process, it was difficult to draw these images the right way so that they were not confusing and they portrayed the message we wanted them to. We had to push through this challenge by simply trying to draw good images. As of right now, we have not gotten any feedback on our comic yet because we have not had the opportunity to present it in class. We are excited to see how our peers can help!
