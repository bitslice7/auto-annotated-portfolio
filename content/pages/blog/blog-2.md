Our font, Hybrid-Serif, was named to clearly reflect its blend of serif and sans-serif characteristics. We wanted a design that was both visually appealing and highly legible, particularly for WPI students using the library. A purely serif or sans-serif font might have been either too formal or too plain, so we created a balance between elegance and readability.

Serifs are the small decorative strokes at the ends of letterforms, adding a refined touch to text. In contrast, sans-serif fonts have cleaner, more geometric shapes, which improve readability by making letters easier to distinguish (Atwell,1). By merging these qualities, we designed a font that is inviting and effective for our purpose.

Designing Hybrid-Serif came with challenges, especially in determining where to place defining lines. Letters with naturally thick strokes were straightforward, but curvier letters like O, C, and J required extra consideration. Vertical-stroke letters, such as I, T, and Y, also posed difficulties. Initially, curved serifs seemed promising, but they disrupted consistency. Instead, we refined the vertical strokes, achieving a more cohesive look.

Feedback led to further refinements. For instance, we hesitated to modify the X, fearing it would resemble the Twitter logo, but an unaltered X stood out too much. Adding two subtle lines solved this issue. We also adjusted the lowercase i and j, removing excessive curves and decorative hearts from their dots to maintain stylistic harmony.

Through iteration and refinement, Hybrid-Serif evolved into a font that balances readability with elegance, encouraging students to feel at home in the library.
