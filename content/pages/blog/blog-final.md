Designing the comic  was a transformative journey. Although I have spent years telling stories through D\&D campaigns and mapmaking, this project marked my first real foray into drawing and narrative creation in comic form. Inspired by Scott McCloud’s insights in \*Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art\*Initially I embraced the six-cell action format each page packed with six panels, about halfway through that proved too much to handle. So it was changed to a more free flowing format to ensure a dynamic and engaging flow of dialogue and visuals. This structure not only allowed me to convey information about the library, but also to illustrate how stepping into the library can spark a student’s academic potential.


Targeted primarily at WPI students, the comic was designed to draw readers into the library and promote the Iliad program. I ensured that words and images complemented each other: when one element presented the main message, the other expanded upon it, keeping each page concise yet captivating. This balanced approach was particularly important given the short attention spans of our audience.



Throughout the creative process, I was fortunate to receive invaluable feedback from talented artist friends. Their advice not only helped shape the dialogue and pacing of the comic but also guided me in refining my visual storytelling. Getting over the initial learning curve to eventually draw clear, effective images was no small feat, but each piece of constructive critique pushed me closer to a final product that truly communicated its intended message.



Emphasizing the characters’ emotions in every frame was key to forging a genuine connection with readers. Each panel was crafted to reflect authentic feelings, inviting the audience to experience the narrative on a personal level.



Now that the library comic is complete, I am proud to present a finished work that not only represents my personal growth as an artist and storyteller but also serves as a compelling invitation for WPI students to explore the library. The positive feedback received since its completion reaffirms that the comic successfully bridges art and knowledge, engaging its audience from the very first panel to the last.
